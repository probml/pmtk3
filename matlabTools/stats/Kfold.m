function  [trainfolds, testfolds] = Kfold(N, K, randomize)
% Compute indices for K-fold cross validaiton
% N = num data
% K = num folds, if K=N, use leave-one-out CV
% [trainfolds{i}, testfolds{i}] = indices of i'th fold
% If randomize = 1, we shuffle the indices first
%   This is useful in case the data has some special ordering
%   such as all the positive examples before the negative ones
%
% Example:
% [trainfolds, testfolds] = Kfold(100, 3)
% testfolds{1} = 1:33, trainfolds{1} = 34:100
% testfolds{2} = 34:66, trainfolds{2} = [1:33 67:100]
% testfolds{3} = 67:100, trainfolds{3} = [1:66]
% (last fold gets all the left over so has different length)
