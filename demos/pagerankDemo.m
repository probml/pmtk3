%% Draw a 6-node "tiny web" 
% This is from Section 2.11 of "Numerical Computing with MATLAB"
% by Cleve Moler, SIAM, 2004.  It then simulates the
% computation of Google's PageRank algorithm, by randomly selecting links to
% traverse.  If a link is traversed, the edge and the target node are displayed
% in red.  If the "random surfer" jumps to an arbitrary page, the target node
% is displayed in blue.  The number of hits at each node, and the page rank
% (in %) are displayed % on each node.  Note that after a large number of
% steps, the PageRanks (in percentages) converge to the values given in Section
% 2.11 of Moler (alpha: .321, sigma: .2007, beta: .1705, delta: .1368,
% gamma: .1066, rho: .0643).  See http://www.mathworks.com/moler for more
% details (the pagerank M-file, in particular).
%
% Note that this method is NOT how the PageRank is actually computed.  Instead
% the eigenvalue problem A*x=x is solved for x, where A is the Markov
% transition matrix, A = p*G*D + e*z', where G is the binary matrix used here.
% The method here is a simplistic random-hopping demonstration of the Markov
% process, to motivate the A*x=x formulation of the problem.  In this example,
% A does control how the transitions are made, but the matrix A is not formed
% explicitly.
%
% This demo only operates on a single graph.  It is meant as a simple demo
% only, suitable for in-class use.  To compute the PageRanks for an arbitrary
% graph, use pagerank.m, or the power method (repeat x=A*x until convergence,
% where A is the Markov transition matrix of the web).
%
% Example:
%   pagerankdemo
%
% See also pagerank
%
% I suggest single-stepping a dozen times or so to see the link traversal in
% process, and then type "1000".  Hit control-C to quit.
